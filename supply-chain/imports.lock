There were some hits for `net`, but they were related to serialization and
not actually opening any connections or anything like that.

There were 2 hits of `unsafe` when grepping:
* In `fn as_str` in `impl Buf`
* In `fn serialize` in `impl Serialize for net::Ipv4Addr`

Unsafe review comments can be found in https://crrev.com/c/5350573/2 (this

All two functions from the public API of this crate use `unsafe` to avoid bound
checks for an array access.  Cross-module analysis shows that the offsets can
be statically proven to be within array bounds.  More details can be found in
the unsafe review CL at https://crrev.com/c/5350386.

This crate has been added to Chromium in https://crrev.com/c/3891618.
